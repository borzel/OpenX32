# This shell-script starts some useful software-tools from the USB-Thumbdrive
# as the X32 has only limited amount of RAM and the SD-Card is quite hard to
# access. So by calling this script the following tools will be started:
#
# 1. SSH
# 2. more to come...
#

# startup SSH
./startssh.sh

# start more software here...
